This is a module of the "Langara-Scraper"

  - Find free rooms in Langara, output to days.json

  - Find free time for me based on the courses I have, output to timeCRN.json 

Direction : 
	-	python getDays.py 
	=> check days.json 

	-	python crnLooker.py <CRN> <CRN> ... 
	=> check timeCRN.json 

Requirement: 

  The scripts need "final.json", which is given when we run "update.sh" in the parent directory of the "Langara-Scraper" Suite
